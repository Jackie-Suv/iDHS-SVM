A computational tool for the detection of human DHSs

DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are special chromosomal regions that lose their advanced structures and can be recognized, combined and cut by DNase I enzymes. As a result, these DNA regions become exposed and more easily contacted by enzymes to play their biological roles. Although experimental methods are available for identifying DHSs, they are still labor-intensive. To the best of our knowledge, there is no computational tool available for the detection of human DHSs. In the present study, a computational method was developed to identify human DHSs.

(1) For each submission, the input sequences must be longer than 41 characters and in FASTA format; i.e., each DNA sequence should start with a greater-than symbol (" > ") in the first column. The words right after the " > " symbol in the single initial line are optional and only used for the purpose of identification and description.

(2) If a query sequence contains any illegal characters,the prediction will be stopped with a warning message.
