A computational tool for the detection of human DHSs

DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are special chromosomal regions that lose their advanced structures and can be recognized, combined and cut by DNase I enzymes. As a result, these DNA regions become exposed and more easily contacted by enzymes to play their biological roles. Although experimental methods are available for identifying DHSs, they are still labor-intensive. To the best of our knowledge, there is no computational tool available for the detection of human DHSs. In the present study, a computational method was developed to identify human DHSs.
